# functional programming style avoids side-effects and changing state in your programs by focusing on the application of mathematical functions as its core primitive. 
# we represent data inside our example program using immutable data structures (tuples and namedtuples from the "collections" module built into Python). 
# Immutable data structures cannot be modified in-place and this can help reduce bugs.
